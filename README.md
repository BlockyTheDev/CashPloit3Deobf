# CashPloit3Deobf
The full source code of CashPloit 3 by Garkolym. Made with too much boredom.  
Thanks to RK_01 for helping with the String decryption.

# Why?
Imaging standing up one morning and having nothing to do and just randomly browse through some old files on your PC.  
Randomly stumbling upon a CashPloit3.jar file and having nothing better to do with your life and just start deobfuscating the whole thing.  
My boredom was not big enough to deobf the strings so I just renamed all Classes and Fields and put it away.  
Then suddenly RK_01 came online and I showed him my work. He immediately wanted to help me deobfing this plugin and the work started.  
We made a really bad string deobfuscator which was just was good enough to deobf this plugin.  
The code is so bad that we decided not to publish the deobfuscator. Just in case anyone was wondering.  
After the deobfuscating was done we created a new project in Intellij and added all classes.  
To our surprise there were no big issues and the code worked nearly perfectly.  

So here we are now. The code is now public.
